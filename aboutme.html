    <h1> About Me!</h1>
    <p> My name is Cailee King and I currently attend the University of Rhode Island as an undergraduate student. I am pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in Economics with a minor in Digital Forensics and will be graduating in May 2020! I transferred to URI from Becker College in Worcester, MA for the spring semester of 2018. After graduating from URI I intend on going to the University of New Hampshire to pursue a Master's degree in Economics.</p><br>
    <p> I am from Uxbridge, MA and while taking the CSC 106 course this summer I will also be interning as a data analyst at Definitive Healthcare. When I am not doing either of these things I can usually be found spending time with one of my pets! This line up includes 2 dogs (a German Shepherd and a black flat-coated retriever), 2 Maine Coon cats, and a tortoise. </p>
