    <h1> Welcome to my Programming Portfolio!</h1>
    <p1> My name is Cailee King, and this web site showcases all the programs I have created throughout the course, CSC 106: The Joy of Programming, at the University of Rhode Island. I wrote this site using HTML programming language I learned throughout the course utilizing Khan Academy. As my skills and knowledge improve this site will continuously be updated with completed projects!
